- Redid the MainObject attributes of the Ruined Fornost gate, just to be sure (Not including collision)
- Cleaned up the PTG(pathfinding) of the Ruined Fornost gate / gatehouse as it was narrower on the inside for no reason.
- Removed the two defense perimeters that covered the main entrance to the plaza and the broken wall beside it, replaced them with a single defense perimeter a little closer to the plaza so as to still cover both entrances. CHANGING THIS FIXED THE BUG WHERE THE NEW OVERHAULED AI (courtesy of Fynn) REFUSED TO ENTER THE SETTLEMENT.

AI movement inside the settlement is still a little wonk, with the enemy army splitting up into small groups which attack in turn. I am uncertain if this behaviour is at all linked to any battlefield attributes (the three remaining defense perimeters, or only one existing MainObject is all I could think of) or if that's just a quirk of the new battle AI.
